# Group 5 Project - Staying Current with COVID-19

## User Story
* AS A PROFESSIONAL ADULT I am looking for information regarding COVID-19
  * I WANT TO AVOID news media outlets and search through multiple scientific journal publications at the same time
  * SO THAT I can be appropriately informed about COVID-19 while also conserving my search time to fit it into my busy work schedule


## Acceptance Criteria
* GIVEN A COVID journal and statistics dashboard with responsive buttons and selection options.
* WHEN I open the application the current/most recent journal articles from each publication are populated in their associated columns
  * THEN I can sift through the titles and excerpts of each journal article 
* WHEN I open the application the most recent COVID-19 statistics within Ontario are displayed
  * THEN I can select another province to search for their associated statistics
* WHEN I click on the Vaccine button
  * THEN Iâ€™m presented with articles relating to COVID-19 vaccines
* WHEN I click on a journal article
  * THEN I am taken to another window where I can access the journal article and read it fully.
