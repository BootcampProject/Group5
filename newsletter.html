            <h2>Thank you for registering for our Newsletter, <span id="getname"></span>!!!</h2>
            <p>Every 2 weeks you will be receiving the most recent COVID-19 updates to <span id="getemail"></span>:

            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has proven the importance of clear, concise, and accurate communication and
                knowledge translation. News media outlets and publications have been clouding the accuracy of
                information regarding COVID-19 that is distributed to the public. In turn, this has caused the general
                public further confusion and misunderstanding of all things COVID-19 related. As such, this application
                is meant to provide you with access to accurate, scientific journal publication resources
                in order to appropriately inform you amidst the misinformation created by the news and media.</p>
            <p>Watch Dr. Supriya Sharma, Chief Medical Advisor at Health Canada, explain how the COVID-19 vaccines were
                reviewed for safety.</p>
