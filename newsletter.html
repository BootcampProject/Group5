            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has proven the importance of clear, concise, and accurate communication and
                knowledge translation. News media outlets and publications have been clouding the accuracy of
                information regarding COVID-19 that is distributed to the public. In turn, this has caused the
                general
                public further confusion and misunderstanding of all things COVID-19 related. As such, this
                application
                is meant to provide you with access to accurate, scientific journal publication resources
                in order to appropriately inform you amidst the misinformation created by the news and media.
